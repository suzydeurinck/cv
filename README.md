# Suzy Deurinck MSc. Animal Science
> Aspiring Data Engineer

## Summary
Drawing upon nearly 10 years of experience as a horse welfare consultant and successful
business owner, I developed my observational skills and ability to identify and interpret subtle
behavioral cues. As a data engineer, I bring this same attention to detail and a holistic
perspective to my work, enabling me to spot connections and maintain a big-picture view of
complex datasets. At Techionista Academy, I learned about Azure, SQL, and Power BI.
 
As someone with a deep-seated passion for helping people, animals, and the planet, I am
committed to using technology as a means of driving positive change. One of my core beliefs
is that diversity and inclusivity are critical to improving the quality of decision-making in the
world of data and AI. By bringing a unique perspective and a deep sense of empathy to my
work, I strive to contribute to a more equitable and sustainable future for all.
